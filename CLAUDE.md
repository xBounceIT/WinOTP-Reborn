# WinOTP - Reborn

This is a C# .NET 10 Windows 11 Desktop TOTP manager App built with WinUI3.

## UI
- Make sure to always respect WinUI3 guidelines

## Tooling
- Always use the host Windows .NET install from WSL.
- Run `dotnet` as `"/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe"` for restore/build/test/run.
- Do not rely on a Linux/WSL `dotnet` shim/path.
- Quick check command: `"/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe" --info`
